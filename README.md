You're a pilot stranded in the middle of space and need to survive as long as possible, but there is a shower of stars flying towards you.
Dodge and weave in between the stars as long as possible, but the longer you survive, the more stars approach. There are some large stars too, which can 
explode into many more smaller stars, so watch out behind you. If you take damage, fear not; there is a health item that can appear to rejuvenate your
ship back to full health, so keep going until the bitter end. But once you lose all three lives, it's game over.

To start the game, click the start game button with the mouse, and when it's game over, you'll be brought to a game over screen showing the time you survived for.
and you can press the main menu button to go back to the start screen.
